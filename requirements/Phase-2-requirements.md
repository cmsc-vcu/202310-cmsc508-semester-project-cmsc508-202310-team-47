CMSC 508 - Semester project<br/>Database Implementation
================

## Objective

The objective of the second phase of the final project is to implement
the solution that was designed in the first phase using MySQL in a cloud
environment. You may realize that it\<U+00E2\>\<U+20AC\>\<U+2122\>s
necessary to consider modifications to the design in order to have a
working solution satisfying the expected functionality and you should
update your design appropriately, if necessary.

For Phase 2 you will translate the design into a functional solution by:

1.  Creating MySQL database tables using proper data types, constraints,
    and keys according to the design proposed or your revised design.
2.  Populating the tables using sample data, maintaining the consistency
    and integrity of the data. There should be enough sample data to
    allow for a meaningful demonstration of the functionality of the
    solution.
3.  Creating SQL queries to select, insert, update, and delete data from
    tables, according to the expected functionality described in the
    problem statement.
4.  Creating views, triggers, and procedures to facilitate the usage and
    manipulation of the database.
5.  Implementing user roles and authentication procedures needed to keep
    your data secure.
6.  Creating a web interface that connects to your cloud-based database
    implementation to give the end user the ability to access and
    manipulate the data.
7.  Creating a recorded demonstration of the functionality of your
    database and how it contributes to the solution to the original
    problem statement.

The main aim is to implement the database satisfying the information and
functional requisites extracted from the analysis of the problem
statement, in order to demonstrate your expertise and proficiency on the
use of database methodologies to create an accurate and faithful
database. The implementation must reflect all expected information,
scenarios, and functionality.

## Guidelines

(As of 8/21/2022 I am still determining the appropriate database
platform. Possible options include AWS, Google, Azure or homegrown.)

You are responsible for providing all necessary information for the
evaluation of your projects. Should any username/password be required to
access the database, they must be provided as well so that I can test
all the functionality of the database and its correctness.

All transactions, errors and constraint-checking must be carried out
using the proper database procedures. The consistency, integrity, and
security of the information in the database is a priority and will be
evaluated.

## Deliverables

- **Final Documentation:**

1.  Updated problem statement, if any changes were made to it.
2.  Updated Entity-Relationship diagram.
3.  Updated relational design (including functional dependencies and
    normalization).
4.  Database: SQL scripts for creating the database tables, views,
    triggers, and procedures.
5.  Interface software: source code and documentation of the interface
    to the database. This is to be provided as a link to your GitHub
    repository for the project.
6.  Project demonstration. (see below)

- **Demonstration of a running database:**

You will record a presentation of the finished project that demonstrates
the design and functionality of the finished database and how it solves
the problem posed by your project. The recording should be approximately
5 minutes in length.

Use of 3rd-party code is allowed, as long as it is referenced properly.
However, the project will be evaluated according to your
team\<U+00E2\>\<U+20AC\>\<U+2122\>s capability of developing your own
code, and the completeness and functionality of the database.

Additionally, you will be evaluating the members of your team and
yourself for teamwork qualities. **Non-contributing teammates will
receive a reduction in the semester project grade.**

For your web-based interface, use of HTML5, AJAX, CSS, etc. technologies
will be positively valued but it is not a requisite (i.e., this is not a
web programming course, but learning such languages will be beneficial
for your professional career).

`	`Cybersecurity is an undeniably growing field where the globe is trying day by day to defend against cyber attacks. Companies often have their own cyber teams and platforms that conduct, run, and provide security measures to their company, information, and sensitive data. Although there are many different kinds of attacks there is often a viable approach to prevent data loss and victimization from different threats. Virginia has recently passed a law requiring that companies report all cyber attacks. To address this, we create a database that lists and track information regarding each specific attack within a company.

`	`This system provides information regarding the cyber indecent and the attack that occurred to the company. It allows users and readers to view details of the attack such as the type of attack, the location of the perpetrator and the system that it affected, the significance and impact of the attack, the cyber team that responded to and addressed the attack, as well as the software or program that first detected the attack. The overarching goal of this database is to create a report that includes a summary of cyber incidents that a company incurs. It will not provide information regarding the specific solution that the cyber team implemented to resolve the attack or the specific data that was lost or security method that was breached. 

`	`This database holds a significant amount of information regarding the cyber-attack. Specifically, there are 5 entities. The entities include company, with attributes

Company\_name, and location; cyber team, with attributes attackID, incident manager, team members/employeeID; attack, with attributes team\_name and incident manager; report, with attributes company\_name, attack date, and impact; offense detector/software, with attributes tool name; attack, with attributes attack\_id, team\_name, company\_name, tool\_name, perpetrator, impact, attack\_date, attack\_time, vector of execution, and affected systems. Through the use of this database, one will be able to look up specific cyber attacks and the information associated with this attack. One will also be able to determine the location or IP that has the most occurrences of attacks through the use of multiple different queries used to collect information and answer questions regarding the data. 

Describe the users of the system.

`	`This project has 3 team members that each significantly contributed to the development and finalization of the final product. Although each individual was expected to understand and contribute towards all areas of the project, there was also a split of team roles to more efficiently complete the project by the projected deadline. Regarding the contributions towards the project, each team member contributed towards the creation of the entity relation diagram as well as the creation of the database DML and DDL files. The completion of the 20 query requirements were mostly done by Joel John and Abtin Ghaffari. Furthermore, the project documentation was done mostly by Ramtin Ghaffari, the website implementation was done by Joel John, Abtin Ghaffari, and Ramtin Ghaffari and the video presentation was a combined effort between all team members.

REFLECTION

`	`Throughout the semester-long project, the team agrees that we did the best we could. Although we had many setbacks and mistakes, they proved to be learning opportunities that we would keep in mind the creation of our next database or if we were to redo the project. From the start of the semester, we were able to create an interesting and impactful database that many would deem impressive and applicable to the real world. The creation of the entity relation diagram, DML, and DDL file went well; we were able to accurately and efficiently code the database and write the 20 queries with the correct requirements and specifications. However, the project did have a number of setbacks throughout the semester. We had multiple issues deciding the correct composition and logic of the entity relation diagram which has caused many errors in the creation of the database itself and a fair amount of editing of the DDL and DML SQL files. Another aspect of the project that did not go well was the website implementation. This aspect took many hours of dedication in learning the correct syntax and steps in not only creating a new website, but connecting the website to the functionality of our database. The team members learned a lot about themselves during the project. We learned that a lot of our problems and discussions focused around the implementation of the database can be fixed by having better communication skills. We learned that our ability to communicate our thoughts and ideas were not up to par and can be improved to create a more accepting and forgiving environment. If given another opportunity to work on this project, we would better schedule and plan our time so that we work on the project throughout the whole semester rather running a marathon during the final few weeks of the semester. We would also like to implement more mock data into our database to better show its functionality. Regardless, this project was a major learning experience that enabled us to successfully take this knowledge with us into the real world ready to apply. 


Describe how the semester project can be improved.

`	`Our database and semester project a multitude of flaws and can be improved in many ways. For example, we can add security to the database, improve the presentation, quality, and formatting of the data, improve the queries within the DML file of the database and provide more coherent data to apply our queries to. The logic and structure of our database may also be improved to better meet our project goals.
